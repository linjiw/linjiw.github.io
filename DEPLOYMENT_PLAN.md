```

## 🔥 **Ready to Deploy? Here's How:**

### **Step 1: Prepare Repository Structure**

**Current Situation:**
```
linjiwang/
├── astro-site/          # ← Your new modern website
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── .github/workflows/
└── [hugo files]         # ← Old Hugo site files
```

**Recommended Final Structure:**
```
linjiwang/
├── src/                 # ← Astro site at root level
├── public/
├── package.json
├── .github/workflows/
├── README.md
├── DEV_GUIDE.md
└── hugo-legacy/         # ← Archived Hugo files
```

### **Step 2: Repository Reorganization Commands**

```bash
# From your current location (/astro-site/)

# 1. Backup current Hugo site
cd ..
mkdir hugo-legacy
mv !(astro-site) hugo-legacy/ 2>/dev/null || true

# 2. Move Astro files to root
mv astro-site/* .
mv astro-site/.* . 2>/dev/null || true
rmdir astro-site

# 3. Clean up legacy files that might conflict
rm -f hugo-legacy/package.json hugo-legacy/.github -rf 2>/dev/null || true
```

### **Step 3: GitHub Pages Setup**

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings:**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/linjiw/linjiwang/settings/pages`
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - **Save Settings**

2. **Verify Workflow File:**
   - Ensure `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is in repository root
   - Check workflow triggers on `push` to `main` branch

### **Step 4: Test and Deploy**

```bash
# 1. Test build locally
npm run build
npm run preview
# Verify everything works at http://localhost:4321

# 2. Commit and push to trigger deployment
git add .
