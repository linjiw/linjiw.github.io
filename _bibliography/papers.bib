  abbr={In Prep},
  title={Grounded Curriculum Learning: A Novel Framework for Real-World Reinforcement Learning in Robotics},
  author={Wang, Linji and Zhao, Liang and others},
  booktitle={In Preparation for ICRA 2025},
  year={2024},
  abstract={We present Grounded Curriculum Learning (GCL), a novel framework that improves real-world reinforcement learning in robotics by aligning simulated task distributions with real-world tasks while considering task sequences and robot performance history. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in sample efficiency and training stability.},
