I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at George Mason University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics with a focus on Reinforcement Learning. My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and robotic manipulation.

Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the AI & Robotics Lab, where I'm developing curriculum learning approaches for robotic manipulation tasks and exploring sim-to-real transfer techniques. My work aims to bridge the gap between simulated environments and real-world deployment of intelligent robotic systems.

Prior to my Ph.D., I worked at Carnegie Mellon University's CERLab, where I developed real-time 3D perception pipelines and AR visualization systems for robot guidance. I have published research in top-tier conferences including ICRA and ICCV workshops.

My technical expertise spans deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow), robotics platforms (ROS/ROS2, MoveIt), and computer vision libraries. I'm particularly interested in generative models (GANs, CycleGANs) and their applications in domain adaptation and style transfer.

Feel free to explore my [publications](/linjiwang/publications/), [projects](/linjiwang/projects/), and [CV](/linjiwang/cv/) to learn more about my research and experience.
