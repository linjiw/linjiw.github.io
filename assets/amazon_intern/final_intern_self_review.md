Q1. Project work.
Provide a high-level overview of your project, including goals and key deliverables. Summarize progress toward deliverables and results you've achieved. Include comments on work you have planned for the future when applicable. (200 words maximum)
Q1:
I delivered two high-impact projects addressing RDS Proxy deployment challenges where engineers faced 47.3% test success rate and 8+ hour diagnostic cycles.

**IPEBench Data Visualization Platform**: Built interactive dashboard (2,782 lines, CR-205539208) transforming IPEBench from "black box" to transparent system. Delivered 5 analysis tabs with 8 visualization types, reducing diagnostic time to 15 minutes. Improved success rate to 90% by revealing root causes: insufficient warmup, excessive iterations, outlier sensitivity. Implemented statistical engine (Welch's t-test, Cohen's d) with 14-column CSV export. Created zero-infrastructure solution maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

**RDS Rialto Regression Testing**: Built complete regression testing system from scratch in 3-4 weeks—statistical framework, Streamlit dashboard, and automated detection. Delivered 10,000+ lines (65 commits) implementing Welch's t-test, Mann-Whitney U, power analysis, Bonferroni correction. Achieved 200,000x dashboard optimization, 99% statistical confidence, adaptive sampling.

Both projects transformed manual processes into automated, statistically rigorous systems. Future: ML-based anomaly detection, CI/CD integration.

Key impacts: Unblocked deployments, improved engineering productivity, established extensible architectures.


Q2. Skills development.
What skills have you demonstrated proficiency in related to this role (e.g., Excel, writing, new coding languages, data structures, algorithms, code quality, etc.)? What skills are you working to improve? (160 words maximum)
Q2:
**Demonstrated Proficiencies:**
- **Advanced Python Development**: Built production systems using Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, SciPy; achieved 200,000x performance optimization through intelligent caching
- **Statistical Analysis**: Implemented Welch's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, power analysis, effect sizes, and Bonferroni corrections for reliable regression detection
- **Data Engineering**: Designed comprehensive CSV schemas, time-series collection systems, and multi-format export pipelines
- **Software Architecture**: Created modular, backward-compatible solutions with minimal changes to existing codebases
- **Performance Optimization**: Developed dual-layer caching, progress tracking, and adaptive sampling systems
- **Technical Communication**: Presented complex statistical concepts through intuitive visualizations to diverse stakeholders

**Skills Improving:**
- **AWS Service Integration**: Deepening understanding of cross-service integration patterns and infrastructure optimization
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Developing judgment for technology choices balancing immediate needs with long-term scalability
- **Stakeholder Management**: Enhancing ability to navigate complex organizational dynamics and build consensus across teams
- **ML/AI Applications**: Exploring machine learning approaches for predictive performance analysis


Q3. Actioning feedback.
What feedback did you receive and how did you apply it? (160 words maximum)
Q3:
**Mentor Feedback:**
- Jake Moh: "Minimize core changes" → Designed opt-in features (`--save-raw-data`) ensuring 100% backward compatibility
- "Address recurring questions" → Created 5 specialized tabs targeting P90 vs P100 success rates, iteration convergence

**Stakeholder Integration:**
- Lucas/Rozelle: "Easier setup needed" → Built automated launcher, single-command deployment
- Code Review (CR-205539208): "Enhance error handling" → Added robust error handling, cross-platform compatibility
- Engineers: "Show confidence levels" → Implemented power analysis, sample size recommendations, confidence intervals

**Cross-Team Adaptation:**
- PAS (Felipe Reyes)/BMS (Aaron An): 3+ week integration complexity → Led strategic pivot to RDSRialtoManualTestScripts
- Performance team: "Need instant analysis" → Achieved 200,000x speedup via dual-layer caching

Each feedback strengthened solutions, resulting in production-ready systems exceeding initial requirements while maintaining simplicity.


Q4. Dealing with ambiguity.
What ambiguous situations did you run into and how did you adapt? (160 words maximum)
Q4:
**IPEBench Mystery**: 52.7% failure rate when testing identical images. Built visualization to "see" the data, revealing root causes: insufficient warmup (30s→60s), excessive iterations (8→4), table size (10M→1M), isolation issues. Transformed black box into transparent system achieving 90% success.

**PAS Integration Ambiguity**: Undocumented requirements led to proactive engagement with PAS (Felipe Reyes) and BMS (Aaron An) teams. Discovered 3+ week KTLO integration complexity. Led strategic pivot to RDSRialtoManualTestScripts, applying visualization expertise to proven tool.

**Statistical Framework**: IPEBench lacked test selection guidance. Deep-dived source code, implemented automatic test selection (Shapiro-Wilk→Welch's/Mann-Whitney), added Bonferroni correction and power analysis.

Approach: Transform ambiguity into structured problems through systematic investigation, stakeholder engagement, and data-driven pivots delivering value within constraints.


Q5. Leadership Principles.
Select at least 3 Leadership Principles and rate them either as a superpower (strength) or growth area. Provide context and evidence for the rating.
Q5:

| Leadership Principle | Strength or Growth Opportunity | Context and Evidence (50 words maximum) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer Obsession** | Strength | Started with engineer's pain: 8-hour diagnostic cycles. Built intuitive dashboards directly addressing their questions. Reduced time to 15 minutes. Conducted stakeholder interviews, creating 5 specialized tabs for recurring problems. |
| **Dive Deep** | Strength | Didn't accept 52.7% failure rate. Dove into IPEBench source code, identified four root causes (warmup, iterations, table size, isolation). Built visualizations revealing patterns. Achieved 90% success rate through deep understanding. |
| **Invent and Simplify** | Strength | Invented zero-infrastructure visualization transforming complex statistics into clear insights. Created 200,000x performance optimization. Simplified CLI from 7→3 arguments. Made regression testing accessible to all engineers, not just statisticians. |
| **Deliver Results** | Strength | Delivered 12,782+ lines production code. Built complete regression framework in 3-4 weeks: statistical tests, dashboard, automation. Impact: 47.3%→90% success rate, 8hr→15min diagnostics, 200,000x speedup. CR-205539208 approved. |
| **Learn and Be Curious** | Strength | Mastered Streamlit, advanced statistics, caching strategies in 12 weeks. Proactively investigated PAS/BMS integration. Researched Netflix/Google best practices. Continuously sought feedback to improve solutions. |
| **Earn Trust** | Growth Opportunity | While delivered reliable technical solutions, developing stronger cross-team relationship building. Learning to better manage stakeholder expectations during project pivots and communicate timeline changes proactively. |
