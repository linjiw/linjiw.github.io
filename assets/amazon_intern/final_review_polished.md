**Q1. Project work.**
*Provide a high-level overview of your project, including goals and key deliverables. Summarize progress toward deliverables and results you’ve achieved. Include comments on work you have planned for the future when applicable. (200 words maximum)*

I delivered two high-impact projects that transformed RDS Proxy's performance testing capabilities, directly addressing critical deployment pipeline challenges.

**IPEBench Data Visualization Platform:** Built an interactive dashboard (2,782 lines of code, CR-205539208) transforming IPEBench from a "black box" to a transparent system. Delivered 5 analysis tabs with 8 visualization types, reducing diagnostic time to 15 minutes. Improved success rate to 90% by revealing root causes: insufficient warmup, excessive iterations, and outlier sensitivity.

**RDS Rialto Regression Testing System:** Following a strategic pivot, in just four weeks I developed a complete regression testing framework from scratch (10,000+ lines of code). This included building a new dashboard and implementing a rigorous statistical engine with adaptive sampling to achieve 99% confidence.

Both projects transformed manual processes into automated, statistically rigorous systems. Future work includes ML-based anomaly detection and CI/CD integration.

*Key impact: Unblocked deployments, improved engineering productivity, and established extensible architectures.*

**Q2. Skills development.**
*What skills have you demonstrated proficiency in related to this role (e.g., Excel, writing, new coding languages, data structures, algorithms, code quality, etc.)? What skills are you working to improve? (160 words maximum)*

**Demonstrated Proficiencies:**
- **Advanced Python Development:** Built production-grade systems using Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly, delivering over 12,000 lines of code in 12 weeks.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Implemented Welch's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, power analysis, effect sizes, and Bonferroni correction for robust regression detection.
- **Software Architecture:** Designed modular, backward-compatible solutions, including a zero-infrastructure dashboard launcher.
- **Rapid Prototyping & Delivery:** Delivered a complete regression testing framework, from concept to production-ready tool, in a four-week sprint.

**Skills for Improvement:**
- **Strategic Decision Making:** Developing judgment for technology choices balancing immediate needs with long-term scalability.
- **ML/AI Applications:** Exploring machine learning approaches for predictive performance analysis.

**Q3. Actioning feedback.**
*What feedback did you receive and how did you apply it? (160 words maximum)*

**Mentor Feedback (Jake Moh):**
- "Minimize core changes" → Designed opt-in features (`--save-raw-data`) ensuring 100% backward compatibility.
- "Address recurring questions" → Created 5 specialized tabs targeting performance deep dive and iteration convergence.

**Stakeholder Integration:**
- Lucas/Rozelle: "Easier setup needed" → Built an automated launcher for single-command deployment.
- Code Review: "Enhance error handling" → Added robust error handling and cross-platform compatibility.
- Engineers: "Show confidence levels" → Implemented power analysis and confidence intervals.

**Cross-Team Adaptation:**
- PAS/BMS Teams: "3+ week integration complexity" → Led a strategic pivot to RDSRialtoManualTestScripts.

Each piece of feedback strengthened the solutions, resulting in production-ready systems that exceeded initial requirements while maintaining simplicity.

**Q4. Dealing with ambiguity.**
*What ambiguous situations did you run into and how did you adapt? (160 words maximum)*

**IPEBench Reliability Mystery:** Faced with a 52.7% failure rate when testing identical images, I built a visualization platform to "see" the data. This transformed the black-box problem, revealing root causes (insufficient warmup, excessive iterations, table size, poor isolation) and enabling fixes that achieved a 90% success rate.

**Navigating Integration Ambiguity:** After discovering a 3+ week integration blocker for the PAS system, I led a decisive pivot. In just four weeks, I built an entire regression testing framework for the more reliable `RDSRialtoManualTestScripts` from the ground up, reapplying my visualization work to deliver a higher-impact solution without a timeline slip.

**Clarifying the Statistical Framework:** IPEBench’s test selection logic was unclear. I deep-dived into the source code and implemented a robust system with automatic test selection, Bonferroni correction, and power analysis to ensure statistical rigor.

**Q5. Leadership Principles.**
*Select at least 3 Leadership Principles and rate them either as a superpower (strength) or growth area. Provide context and evidence for the rating.*

| Leadership Principle | Strength or Growth Opportunity | Context and Evidence (50 words maximum) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer Obsession** | Strength | I started with the engineer's pain: 8-hour diagnostic cycles. I built intuitive dashboards that directly addressed their recurring questions, reducing diagnostic time to 15 minutes and making their lives easier. |
| **Dive Deep** | Strength | I didn't accept the 52.7% failure rate. I dove into IPEBench's source code, identified four root causes (warmup, iterations, table size, isolation), and implemented fixes that raised the success rate to 90%. |
| **Invent and Simplify** | Strength | I invented a visualization platform that simplified a complex, manual analysis process into a single command. My adaptive sampling system simplified data collection by automating it to achieve 99% statistical power. |
| **Deliver Results** | Strength | Delivered two production-ready projects. After a late-stage pivot, I built an entire regression testing framework (10k+ lines) in just 4 weeks. Measurable impact: test reliability improved from 47% to 90%, diagnostic time cut from 8 hours to 15 minutes. |
| **Learn and Be Curious** | Strength | Mastered Streamlit, advanced statistics, and caching strategies in 12 weeks. Proactively investigated PAS/BMS integration. Continuously sought feedback to improve solutions. |
| **Earn Trust** | Growth Opportunity | While I delivered reliable technical solutions, I am developing stronger cross-team relationship building skills. I am learning to better manage stakeholder expectations during project pivots and communicate timeline changes proactively. |
