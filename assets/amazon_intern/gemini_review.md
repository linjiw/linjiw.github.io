**Q1. Project work.**
Provide a high-level overview of your project, including goals and key deliverables. Summarize progress toward deliverables and results you've achieved. Include comments on work you have planned for the future when applicable. (200 words maximum)

I delivered two high-impact projects that transformed RDS Proxy's performance testing capabilities, directly addressing critical deployment pipeline challenges.

**IPEBench Data Visualization Platform**: To combat an unreliable 47.3% test success rate, I built an interactive dashboard (2,782 lines) that reduced diagnostic time from 8+ hours to 15 minutes. By providing visibility into root causes, my work enabled data-driven optimizations that improved the test success rate to 90%.

**RDS Rialto Regression Testing System**: Following a strategic pivot, in just **four weeks** I developed a complete regression testing framework from scratch (10,000+ lines, 65 commits). This included building a new dashboard with a 200,000x performance optimization and implementing a rigorous statistical engine with adaptive sampling to achieve 99% confidence.

Both projects transformed manual, error-prone processes into automated, statistically rigorous systems that are now in active use, improving deployment velocity and engineering productivity. Future work includes integrating ML-based anomaly detection.

**Q2. Skills development.**
What skills have you demonstrated proficiency in related to this role (e.g., Excel, writing, new coding languages, data structures, algorithms, code quality, etc.)? What skills are you working to improve? (160 words maximum)

**Demonstrated Proficiencies:**
*   **Advanced Python Development**: Built production-grade systems using Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly, delivering over 12,000 lines of code in 12 weeks.
*   **Statistical Analysis**: Implemented Welch's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, power analysis, effect sizes, and Bonferroni correction for robust regression detection.
*   **Software Architecture**: Designed modular, backward-compatible solutions, including a zero-infrastructure dashboard launcher.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Engineered a 200,000x performance improvement in a dashboard through a dual-layer caching system.
*   **Rapid Prototyping & Delivery**: Delivered a complete regression testing framework, from concept to production-ready tool, in a four-week sprint.

**Skills for Improvement:**
I am focused on deepening my expertise in AWS service integration, developing more strategic judgment for technology choices that balance immediate needs with long-term scalability, and enhancing my ability to manage stakeholder expectations during complex project pivots.

**Q3. Actioning feedback.**
What feedback did you receive and how did you apply it? (160 words maximum)

**Mentor Feedback (Jake Moh):**
*   "Minimize core changes" → Designed opt-in features (`--save-raw-data`) ensuring 100% backward compatibility.
*   "Address recurring questions" → Created 5 specialized tabs targeting P90 vs P100 success rates and iteration convergence.

**Stakeholder Integration:**
*   Lucas/Rozelle: "Easier setup needed" → Built an automated, single-command launcher.
*   Code Review (CR-205539208): "Enhance error handling" → Added robust error handling and cross-platform compatibility.

**Cross-Team Adaptation:**
*   PAS/BMS Teams: "3+ week integration complexity" → Led a strategic pivot to RDSRialtoManualTestScripts, applying my visualization expertise to a proven tool. This agility allowed me to deliver a high-impact solution without delay, building a new framework in just four weeks.

**Q4. Dealing with ambiguity.**
What ambiguous situations did you run into and how did you adapt? (160 words maximum)

**IPEBench Mystery**: Faced with a 52.7% failure rate when testing identical images, I built a visualization platform to "see" the data. This transformed the black-box problem, revealing root causes (insufficient warmup, excessive iterations, table size, poor isolation) and enabling fixes that achieved a 90% success rate.

**Rapid Strategic Pivot**: After discovering a 3+ week integration blocker for the PAS system, I led a decisive pivot. In just **four weeks**, I built an entire regression testing framework for the more reliable `RDSRialtoManualTestScripts` from the ground up, reapplying my visualization work to deliver a higher-impact solution without a timeline slip.

**Statistical Framework Uncertainty**: IPEBench’s test selection logic was unclear. I deep-dived into the source code and implemented a robust system with automatic test selection, Bonferroni correction, and power analysis to ensure statistical rigor.

**Q5. Leadership Principles.**
Select at least 3 Leadership Principles and rate them either as a superpower (strength) or growth area. Provide context and evidence for the rating.

| Leadership Principle | Strength or Growth Opportunity | Context and Evidence (50 words maximum) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer Obsession** | Strength | I started with the engineer's pain: 8-hour diagnostic cycles. I built intuitive dashboards that directly addressed their recurring questions, reducing diagnostic time to 15 minutes and making their lives easier. |
| **Dive Deep** | Strength | I didn't accept the 52.7% failure rate. I dove into IPEBench's source code, identified four root causes (warmup, iterations, table size, isolation), and implemented fixes that raised the success rate to 90%. |
| **Invent and Simplify** | Strength | I invented a zero-infrastructure visualization platform that simplified a complex, manual analysis process into a single command. My adaptive sampling system simplified data collection by automating it to achieve 99% statistical power. |
| **Deliver Results** | Strength | Delivered two production-ready projects. After a late-stage pivot, I built an entire regression testing framework (10k+ lines) in just 4 weeks. Measurable impact: test reliability improved from 47% to 90%, diagnostic time cut from 8 hours to 15 minutes. |
| **Bias for Action** | Strength | Faced with a multi-week blocker, I didn't wait. I immediately proposed and executed a pivot, building a complete, alternative solution from scratch in four weeks. This bias for action prevented project failure and delivered a superior result. |
| **Earn Trust** | Growth Opportunity | While I delivered reliable technical solutions, I am working on developing stronger cross-team relationship-building skills. I want to improve how I communicate project pivots and timeline adjustments to maintain and build trust even through change. |
