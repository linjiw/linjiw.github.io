# Amazon Intern Self Review Strategy (Integrated)

## 1. Understand the Review Context
- Your self-review is evaluated on two dimensions: **performance** (what you achieved) and **potential** (your growth and future impact).
- Anchor your self-assessment to Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles (LPs).
- Peer and manager feedback are important; proactively seek feedback from at least 5-6 peers.

## 2. Core Structure & Content
- **Length:** Max 2 pages. Be concise and evidence-based.
- **Format:** Use the provided template. Remove instruction pages before submitting.
- **Tone:** Professional, specific, and honest.

## 3. Key Sections & Strategies

### A. Project Overview & Deliverables
- Clearly state your project goals, key deliverables, and results.
- Use quantifiable metrics (e.g., "reduced diagnostic time by 80%", "delivered 5 analysis tabs").
- Highlight technical complexity and cross-team collaboration.

### B. Skills & Growth
- List technical and soft skills demonstrated (e.g., Python, AWS, data visualization, communication).
- Show progression: what you learned, how you applied feedback, and areas you are still improving.

### C. Feedback & Coachability
- Reference specific feedback from mentor/manager/peers and how you acted on it.
- Demonstrate a growth mindset and adaptability.

### D. Dealing with Ambiguity
- Describe ambiguous situations and your approach to resolving them.
- Emphasize problem-solving, stakeholder management, and resilience.

### E. Leadership Principles (LPs)
- Select 3+ LPs most relevant to your work.
- For each, rate as "superpower" (strength) or "growth area" and provide specific evidence (50 words max per LP).
- Example LPs for technical interns: Customer Obsession, Ownership, Invent and Simplify, Dive Deep, Deliver Results.

## 4. Best Practices from Amazon Engineers & Ex-Directors
- **Immediately clarify expectations** with your manager/mentor. Ask: "What would an excellent intern deliver by the end of this internship?"
- **Break down your project into milestones** and track progress.
- **Document everything**: keep a paper trail of your work, feedback, and results.
- **Proactively seek feedback** from peers and act on it.
- **Tie your actions to LPs** in your self-review for maximum impact.
- **Be honest about growth areas**—showing self-awareness is valued.
- **Highlight impact and business value**, not just technical details.

## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Being too general or vague—always use specific examples and metrics.
- Ignoring feedback or not showing growth.
- Focusing only on technical work—include collaboration, communication, and learning.
- Overlooking the importance of LPs—explicitly connect your actions to them.
- Exceeding word/page limits—be concise.

## 6. Peer & Manager Feedback
- Peer feedback is structured: "Superpowers" and "Areas of improvement" (60 words each).
- You can select up to 3 LPs your peer championed and 3 for growth.
- Manager feedback is critical for stack ranking and promotion.
