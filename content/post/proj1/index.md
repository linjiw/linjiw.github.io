title: Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection
subtitle: The Vibrant Transformation of Prokudin-Gorskii's Photo Archive

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: This project requires you to use image processing techniques to create a color image from the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate photographs, with the goal of producing an image with as few visual artifacts as possible. A digital picture of a glass plate, with its three channels arranged from top to bottom as BGR (see Figure 1), serves as the process's input. Our task is to isolate the three channels and properly align them.

## Matching Metric

Image matching means to manipulate image to ensure the best results for your similarity metrics. Thus, it is important to choose an efficient and accurate image matching metrics. For this assignment, I explored Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) and Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) functions. The objective is to maximize or minimize one of these functions by searching and manipulating the images.

**Sum of Squared Differences** SSD  is calculated     based on the following equation:

where *I* and  *H* are function of two images and *x*,*y* are pixels positions.

**Normalized Cross Correlation** NNC is calculated     based on the following equation:
