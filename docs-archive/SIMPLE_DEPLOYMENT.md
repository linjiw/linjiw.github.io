# 🚀 Simple GitHub Pages Deployment (No Netlify)

## One-Time Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/linjiw/linjiwang/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
3. Click "Save"

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
- The workflow will run automatically
- First deployment: ~10 minutes
- Future updates: ~2-3 minutes

### Step 3: Access Your Site
- **GitHub Pages URL**: https://linjiw.github.io/linjiwang/
- **Custom Domain** (optional): Configure DNS to point to GitHub Pages

## ✅ That's It!

Your website is now live and will update automatically every time you push to the main branch.

## 📁 Your Real Projects (Verified)

Based on your actual content, your website showcases:

### Computer Vision Projects
1. **When Cats meet GANs** - DCGANs and CycleGANs implementation
2. **Gradient Domain Fusion** - Poisson blending for seamless image merging
3. **Colorizing Historical Photos** - Prokudin-Gorskii collection alignment
4. **Neural Style Transfer** - Style optimization with CNNs

### Your Sections
- `/ai` - AI research and projects
- `/robotics` - Robotics work
- `/sde` - Software development
- `/rl` - Reinforcement learning

## 🔍 How It Works

```
Push to GitHub → GitHub Actions → Build Hugo Site → Deploy to Pages
```

The workflow file (`.github/workflows/hugo.yml`) handles everything automatically.

## 📝 Updating Content

### To Update Your Resume
1. Edit: `content/resume/data.yaml`
2. Push changes: `git push`
3. Site updates automatically

### To Add New Projects
1. Create new post: `content/post/your-project/index.md`

## ⚠️ No Netlify Needed

We've removed Netlify completely. GitHub Pages provides:
- ✅ Free hosting
- ✅ HTTPS support
- ✅ Custom domain support
- ✅ Automatic deployments
- ✅ No build limits

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't appear:
1. Check Actions tab: https://github.com/linjiw/linjiwang/actions
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
3. Wait 10 minutes for first deployment

### To test locally:
```bash
hugo server -D
# Visit: http://localhost:1313
```
