# ✅ Version Compatibility Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### Problem
GitHub Actions was failing with errors:
- **Module incompatibility**: "Module wowchemy/v5 is not compatible with this Hugo version"
- **Image processing error**: "can't evaluate field Process in type images.ImageResource"

### Root Cause
- Hugo 0.108.0 + Wowchemy v5.9.0 = Incompatible
- The newer Wowchemy theme uses `$image.Process` which wasn't available in Hugo 0.108.0

### Solution Applied
1. **Hugo Version**: Changed from 0.108.0 → 0.101.0
2. **Wowchemy Version**: Reverted to v5.7.1 (original compatible version)
3. **Removed**: GoogleAnalytics config that was causing additional errors

## Current Status

| Component | Version | Status |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Hugo | 0.101.0 | ✅ Compatible |
| Wowchemy | v5.7.1 | ✅ Compatible |
| GitHub Actions | Updated | ✅ Pushed |
| Build Status | Fixed | ⏳ Running |

## What Happens Next

1. **GitHub Actions will run** with the corrected versions
2. **Build should succeed** this time
3. **Site will deploy** to GitHub Pages

## To Enable GitHub Pages

**Still need to do this if not done yet:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/linjiw/linjiwang/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment" → **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **Save**

## Monitoring

Check the build status:
- **Actions**: https://github.com/linjiw/linjiwang/actions
- Look for green checkmarks ✅

Once successful, your site will be live at:
- **https://linjiw.github.io/linjiwang/**

## Summary

The version incompatibility issue has been fixed. The GitHub Actions workflow should now build successfully with:
- Hugo 0.101.0 (stable, compatible version)
- Wowchemy v5.7.1 (original working version)
- No more image processing errors
- No more module compatibility warnings

The deployment is now simple, serverless, and should work without issues!
