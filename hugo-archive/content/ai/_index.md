# AI Research & Development

Welcome to my AI research portfolio. I specialize in deep learning, computer vision, and neural architecture search, with a focus on developing innovative solutions for real-world problems.

## Research Interests

- **Deep Learning**: Neural architecture search, model optimization, and transfer learning
- **Computer Vision**: 3D scene understanding, object detection, and semantic segmentation  
- **Generative AI**: GANs, diffusion models, and style transfer
- **Multi-modal Learning**: Vision-language models and cross-modal representations

## Featured Projects

### Neural Style Transfer
Advanced implementation of neural style transfer using various GAN architectures, achieving state-of-the-art results in artistic style transfer.

### 3D Scene Understanding
Real-time 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation for augmented reality applications using deep learning.

### GAN Photo Editing
Interactive photo editing system using generative adversarial networks for semantic image manipulation.
