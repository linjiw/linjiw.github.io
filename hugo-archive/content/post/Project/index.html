As we delved deeper into the topic, we were astounded by the intricate handling of the filter bank that was mentioned. Our curiosity was piqued, and we found ourselves deeply interested in the concept. Moreover, we were already drawn to the idea of text-to-image conversion and its potential applications. We felt compelled to explore the intricacies of Giga GAN further and decided to undertake a project to reproduce the code and learn more about its text-to-image processing techniques.</p> <p><img src="data/GigaGAN%20model.png" alt="GigaGAN" title="GigaGAN"></p> <h3 id="challenges-in-gigagan">Challenges in GigaGAN</h3> <p>However, after reading the entire paper, we realized the serious shortage of computing resources. (The smallest version of Giga GAN in the paper is trained on 64 A-100 GPU.) So, we plan to only create a ‚Äútoy‚Äù version of Giga GAN to showcase its implementation ideas. After referring to the GitHub code to implement the forward part of the model, we decided to select some parts from the full model in the original paper for experimentation. In the end, we chose clip loss, matching aware loss, multi-scale loss, and filter bank.</p> <p><img src="./data/gigagan%20model%20size.png" alt="GigaGAN model Size" title="GigaGAN Model Size"></p> <p>We have written the code for these parts based on the paper. However, even if we use a very small batch size (which is 2), the model could only be trained on our GPU when incorporating the matching aware loss and clip loss. When multi-scale loss or filter bank is added, the GPU‚Äôs memory is insufficient.</p> <p>The dataset we use is a Pokemon dataset with text and images paired. This text will provide a simple description of the image, with key information including color, species, and action.</p> <p><img src="./data/pokemon_dataset_small.png" alt="Pokemon Dataset" title="Pokemon Dataset"></p> <h3 id="results-in-gigagan">Results in GigaGAN</h3> <p>In the beginning, we only added the most basic GAN loss without any condition to test the ability to generate clear images: that is, the model only pays attention to the authenticity of the generated images.</p> <p><img src="./data/pokemon%20unconditional.png" alt="Pokemon Unconditional" title="Pokemon Unconditional"></p> <p>It can be seen that the generated image still has a rough outline, although the details are not satisfactory. Also, it can be seen that the colors, contours, and patterns all have certain rules, and the generated images have diversity.</p> <p>Then we tried to add a na√Øve text condition to observe the results:</p> <p><img src="./data/drawing%20of%20a%20brown%20and%20black%20Pokemon.png" alt="drawing of a brown and black Pokemon" title="drawing of a brown and black Pokemon"> <strong>drawing of a brown and black Pokemon</strong></p> <p>It can be seen that the image quality has significantly decreased compared to not incorporating text conditions. It can be seen that the generated image roughly matches the content described in the text, but its shape is relatively strange. It means that the addition of text conditions significantly makes training more difficult to converge.</p> <p>Then we added matching loss for training and observed the results. It can be seen that the colors described in the generated image and text can match, but the shape is relatively irregular, indicating that the training did not converge well.</p> <p><img src="./data/drawing%20of%20a%20brown%20and%20black%20Pokemon%202.png" alt="drawing of a brown and black Pokemon 2" title="drawing of a brown and black Pokemon"> <strong>drawing of a brown and black Pokemon with matching loss</strong></p> <p>Then we added clip loss for training and observed the results. The generated images have no meaning, this is a completely non-convergent model. This indicates that our designed clip loss makes training extremely difficult to converge.</p> <p><img src="data/drawing%20of%20a%20brown%20and%20black%20Pokemon%20clip.png" alt="drawing of a brown and black Pokemon 3" title="drawing of a brown and black Pokemon with clip"> <strong>drawing of a brown and black Pokemon with clip loss</strong></p> <p>Besides the visual differences, the quantitative results also show that the clip loss did not work in our case, and even produce worse results.</p> <p><img src="./data/LPIPS.png" alt="LPIPS Results" title="LPIPS"></p> <p>This experiment is done using <a href="https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)</strong></a> for evaluate the simiarity in feature space.</p> <h3 id="conclusions-in-gigagan">Conclusions in GigaGAN:</h3> <ol> <li>The effect of the image we generated is not good, which may be related to the selection of a hyperparameter and the size of the data. Firstly, choosing a smaller batch size can result in poor convergence of the entire training. Secondly, there are too many hyperparameters in this model, and we can only use a few tuning parameters due to our computing resources.</li> <li>GANs, in general, require a substantial amount of computing resources for training and might be unstable when training on small datasets or with insufficient computational resources.</li> </ol> <h3 id="continue-explore-text-2-image">Continue Explore Text 2 Image</h3> <p>Although the implementation effect of Giga GAN is not satisfactory, we are still quite interested in handling clip loss. Thus, we searched for relevant papers and open-source resources and decided to convert text to images again on the diffusion model, and compared its effectiveness with GAN.</p> <h2 id="switch-to-imagen">Switch to Imagen</h2> <p>In this project, we first attempted to reproduce and explore the GigaGAN model, uncovering its remarkable text-to-image processing techniques. Subsequently, we shifted our focus to the <strong>MinImagen</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> architecture, an efficient text-to-image generation model capable of producing high-quality images. Our goal is to experiment with these two models, comparing their strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately share our findings and experiences in the world of image generation.</p> <p><img src="./data/Imagen_model_structure.png" alt="Imagen Architechture" title="Imagen Model"></p> <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3> <p>We began by implementing the <strong>MinImagen</strong> model using the resources provided by <strong>AssemblyAI</strong> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The key component of this implementation is the <strong>Diffusion</strong> part, which has the following characteristics compared with the <strong>GigaGAN</strong> in our training environment.:</p> <ul> <li>Training is fast ‚ö°</li> <li>Sample image generation is slow üê¢</li> <li>Convergence is fast üèÉ</li> <li>Generated results are more meaningful üéØ</li> </ul> <h3 id="experimentation">Experimentation</h3> <p>During the experimentation phase, we encountered some challenges:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Model Size</strong>: The original model with super resolution was too large to fit into a 12GB GPU for training, even with a batch size of 1.</li> <li> <strong>Logging</strong>: We used <strong>Weights &amp; Biases (wandb)</strong> for logging our training process.</li> </ol> <p><img src="data/Imagen_training.png" alt="Imagen Training" title="Validation Loss"></p> <ol> <li> <strong>Remove Super Resolution</strong>: Due to the model‚Äôs large size, we had to remove the super resolution layer for training.</li> </ol> <div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="err">//</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">Training</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">parameters</span><span class="w">
