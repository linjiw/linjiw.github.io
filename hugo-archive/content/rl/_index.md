# Reinforcement Learning Research

Specializing in reinforcement learning with focus on curriculum learning, sample efficiency, and sim-to-real transfer for robotic applications.

## Research Focus

### Curriculum Learning
Developing adaptive curriculum generation methods that automatically adjust task difficulty to accelerate learning in complex environments.

### Sample Efficiency
Investigating techniques to reduce sample complexity including:
- Model-based RL
- Meta-learning
- Transfer learning
- Offline RL

### Multi-Agent RL
Exploring cooperative and competitive multi-agent scenarios with applications in:
- Robotic swarms
- Game playing
- Resource allocation
- Traffic optimization

## Key Contributions

### Adaptive Curriculum Generation
Novel algorithm for automatically generating curricula that adapts to agent performance, achieving 3x faster convergence on manipulation tasks.

### Sim-to-Real Transfer
Domain randomization techniques combined with adversarial training for robust policy transfer from simulation to real robots.

### Hierarchical RL
Temporal abstraction methods for learning reusable skills and accelerating learning in long-horizon tasks.
