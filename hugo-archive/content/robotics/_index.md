# Robotics & Autonomous Systems

Developing next-generation robotic systems that can perceive, reason, and interact with the world through the integration of AI, computer vision, and control theory.

## Research Areas

- **Robotic Manipulation**: Dexterous grasping, object manipulation, and tool use
- **Motion Planning**: Trajectory optimization, path planning in complex environments
- **Computer Vision for Robotics**: Visual servoing, 3D perception, SLAM
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Domain randomization, reality gap bridging

## Current Projects

### Curriculum Learning for Robotic Manipulation
Developing adaptive curriculum generation methods for training robust manipulation policies that transfer from simulation to real robots.

### Vision-based Robotic Control
Real-time visual feedback system for precise robotic manipulation using deep learning and classical control theory.

### Multi-Robot Coordination
Distributed algorithms for multi-robot systems in warehouse automation and search-and-rescue scenarios.

## Lab Experience

- **Computational Engineering & Robotics Laboratory (CERLab)** - CMU
- **AI & Robotics Lab** - George Mason University
