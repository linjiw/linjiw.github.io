## Project Overview

This project developed a comprehensive real-time 3D scene understanding system specifically designed for augmented reality applications in robotic manipulation. The system combines advanced computer vision techniques with AR visualization to provide intuitive guidance for human-robot collaborative tasks.

## Research Context

**Carnegie Mellon University - CERLab (2021-2022)**

This work was conducted at the Computational Engineering & Robotics Laboratory, focusing on bridging the gap between human perception and robotic understanding of 3D environments. The goal was to create an AR interface that could guide operators in complex manipulation tasks while providing real-time feedback about the robot's perception of the scene.

## Technical Challenge

Traditional AR systems for robotics face several limitations:
- **Latency Issues**: Real-time requirements for safe human-robot interaction
- **Tracking Accuracy**: Precise 6DOF pose estimation in dynamic environments  
- **Occlusion Handling**: Robust tracking despite partial object visibility
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Fusing RGB, depth, and inertial sensor data

## System Architecture

### Real-time Perception Pipeline

**Multi-Sensor Fusion:**
```python
class ScenePerceptionPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rgb_camera = RGBSensor()
        self.depth_camera = DepthSensor()
        self.imu = InertialSensor()
        self.object_detector = YOLOv5()
        self.pose_estimator = PnPSolver()
        
    def process_frame(self, timestamp):
        rgb_frame = self.rgb_camera.get_frame()
        depth_frame = self.depth_camera.get_frame()
        
        # Multi-stage processing pipeline
        objects = self.detect_objects(rgb_frame)
        poses = self.estimate_poses(objects, depth_frame)
        scene_graph = self.build_scene_graph(poses)
