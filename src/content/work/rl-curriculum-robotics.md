## Project Overview

This research project focuses on developing novel curriculum learning algorithms specifically designed for robotic manipulation tasks. The goal is to create adaptive learning systems that can efficiently train robots to perform complex manipulation tasks by automatically adjusting task difficulty based on the robot's current capabilities.

## Research Motivation

Traditional reinforcement learning approaches for robotics often struggle with:
- **Sparse Rewards**: Manipulation tasks typically have sparse reward signals
- **High-Dimensional State Spaces**: Robot control involves complex joint configurations
- **Sample Efficiency**: Real robot training is expensive and time-consuming
- **Sim-to-Real Gap**: Policies trained in simulation often fail on real robots

## Technical Approach

### Adaptive Curriculum Generation

**Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment:**
- Real-time assessment of robot's current skill level
- Automatic generation of appropriately challenging tasks
- Progressive increase in task complexity as skills improve

**Multi-Modal Task Representation:**
```python
class CurriculumTask:
    def __init__(self, object_properties, environment_config, success_criteria):
        self.object_mass = object_properties['mass']
        self.object_shape = object_properties['geometry']
        self.workspace_constraints = environment_config['bounds']
        self.success_threshold = success_criteria['tolerance']
        
    def get_difficulty_score(self):
        # Compute task difficulty based on multiple factors
        return self.compute_complexity_metric()
```

### Hierarchical Skill Learning

**Primitive Skills Development:**
- Grasping various objects with different shapes and materials
- Pick-and-place operations with increasing precision requirements
- Tool usage and manipulation in constrained environments

**Complex Task Composition:**
- Combining primitive skills for multi-step manipulation
- Sequential task execution with dependency management
- Error recovery and replanning capabilities

## Implementation Architecture

### Simulation Environment

**IsaacGym Integration:**
- GPU-accelerated physics simulation for parallel training
- Realistic robot dynamics and contact modeling
- Domain randomization for robust policy learning

**Custom Manipulation Tasks:**
- Modular task generation framework
- Parameterized difficulty progression
- Automatic curriculum scheduling

### Algorithm Framework

**Curriculum Learning Pipeline:**

1. **Task Generator**: Creates tasks at appropriate difficulty levels
2. **Policy Network**: Actor-critic architecture with attention mechanisms
3. **Progress Evaluator**: Monitors learning progress and success rates
4. **Curriculum Scheduler**: Adjusts task difficulty based on performance

**Key Innovations:**
- **Adaptive Sampling**: Intelligent selection of training tasks
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balancing success rate and task complexity
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging skills learned in simpler tasks

## Experimental Results

### Simulation Performance

**Training Efficiency:**
- 40% faster convergence compared to random task sampling
- 65% improvement in sample efficiency over standard RL approaches
- Consistent performance across different robot morphologies

**Task Success Rates:**

- **Tool Manipulation**: 87% success rate (vs 62% baseline)  
- **Multi-Object Tasks**: 82% success rate (vs 51% baseline)

### Sim-to-Real Transfer

**Real Robot Validation:**
- Tested on Franka Emika Panda robot arm
- Direct transfer achieved 76% of simulation performance
- With fine-tuning: 91% of simulation performance

**Key Metrics:**
